# API Harness

Warning: new repo and work in progress; not meant for public consumption as of yet!  
Note: This repo is a backup and personal knowledge base. Use at your own discretion.

Current: ui is in place; testing  
Next:  
- implement API requests 
- implement logging and result handling
- cache requests locally 
- build form to access cache data
- build server caching backend

## Goals 
- create a general purpose tool to test API calls
- simplify editing Headers and URL parameters
- run on localhost for security
- cache API calls short term in app memory (not Browser for security)
- cache API calls and results long term in SQLite database
