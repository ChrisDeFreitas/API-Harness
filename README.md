# API Harness

- This repo is a backup and personal knowledge base. Use at your own discretion.
- review ToDo list to see whats waiting to be fixed/implemented
- built for [**FireFox**](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/)
- tested with FireFox on Windows, Linux and iPadOS ( essentially Safari with Firefox skin )

## Goals 
- create a general purpose tool to test API calls
- simplify editing Headers and URL parameters
- simplify viewing of data returned from endpoints
- run on localhost for security
- cache API calls short term in app memory (not Browser for security)
- cache API calls and results long term in SQLite database

## Tech Notes
- JSON and XML can be manually pasted into Result Text
- To Paste JSON/XML directly from Clipboard:  
-- when page accessed via http, requires ([reference](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67440036/navigator-clipboard-readtext-is-not-working-in-js)):  
```
    1. Enter about:config in navigation bar
    2. Click "Accept the Risk and Continue"
    3. Search dom.events.testing.asyncClipboard and set true
```

## ToDo
- build server caching backend; api calls launched and stored on server
- implement new logic for EditBox disable functionality. Disabled params need to exist in local and global caches. Currently, disabled status only stored in EditBox, so lost on React redraw--restored via Reload icon via APIForm.uobj.
- allow request type to be manually set; currently only GET used
