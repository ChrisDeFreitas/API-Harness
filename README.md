# API Harness

## Overivew

Warning: new repo and work in progress; not meant for public consumption as of yet!  

Goal is to create a general purpose tool to test API calls.  Short term it is needed to support upcoming projects, long term its handy.

The idea right now is:
- repo is backup and personal knowledgebase (like my other repos)
- store API calls to different servers for testing and reference
- run only on local machine to store ocnfindential data
- Client: React, Fluent UI, Axios, GraphQL
- Backend: Express-graphql, Sqlite, Sequelize
- test Fluent UI animations and controls
- test GraphQL
